#  Hush Next-Generation

The Next Generation Hush GUI will include an integrated experience for users to do tasks
related to their wallets, sending + receiving HushList memos and mining.

Currently we are focused on HushList-related operations, since other basic wallets
exist. This codebase uses the Electron framework to enable cross-platform support.
